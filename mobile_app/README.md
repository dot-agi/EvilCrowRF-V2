# Evil Crow RF v2 Mobile Controller

Mobile application to control the Evil Crow RF v2 device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The macOS desktop app combines the Bluetooth controller with **Settings → USB
Tools** for wired capture, recovery backups and firmware installation. See
[the macOS guide](macos/README.md) for the complete build and usage workflow.

## Features

- **Device discovery**: Automatically search for the ESP32 device named "EvilCrow_RF2"
- **BLE connection**: Connect to the device with automatic service discovery
- **Send commands**: Text input and quick buttons for common commands
- **Connection status**: Shows current BLE connection state
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Android, iOS, and macOS

- Bluetooth
- Bluetooth Scan
- Bluetooth Connect
- Location (required for BLE on Android)

## Compatibility

- **Android**: 5.0+ (API 21+)
- **iOS**: 12.0+
- **Flutter**: 3.0.0+

## Troubleshooting

### Device not found

1. Make sure the ESP32 is powered on and advertising BLE
2. Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your phone
3. Try restarting the scan

### Connection error

1. Ensure the device is not connected to another app
2. Make sure the ESP32 is not in deep sleep
3. Try restarting the ESP32

### App fails to compile

1. Check Flutter version: `flutter --version`
2. Update dependencies: `flutter pub upgrade`
3. Clear cache: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

## Development

### Adding new commands

1. Open `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
2. Add a new button to the "Quick Commands" section
3. Add handling for the command in the ESP32 code

### Changing the UI

1. Open `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
2. Modify widgets and styles
3. Restart the app

### Debugging BLE

1. Use `print()` in `ble_provider.dart`
2. Check the Flutter console
3. Use nRF Connect to verify the BLE connection
